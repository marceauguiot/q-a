# Question & Answer system

## NLP Project group 6

This Github describes the work of our team composed by Maud Galmich, Sebastien Bordonnat, Christophe Arendt, Thibaut Nicot and myself on 
a NLP Question & Answers project. This project was done in the NLP class of our MSc programm Big Data & Business analytics hold by ESCP Europe.

Two jupyters notebooks are provided in this Github. One is only the code without any graphical output and the other contains graphical output. Since Github does not allow interactive output, I highly recommand to read this notebook with nbviewver at this link : https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marceauguiot/q-a/blob/master/NLP_Q%26A.ipynb. 

I would like to thank you all my team mates for the work done during this project and also our professor Anh-Phuong TA, Lead data scientist at Le Figaro CCM-Benchmark group.

Enjoy reading
